= Wake HDL Simulation Build Rules

:xrefstyle: short

This directory contains a number of Wake files containing build rules for
invoking HDL simulation tools such as Verilator, VCS, and Xcelium.
This document is not meant to be comprehensively document the rules here,
but it at least provides a high-level overview of how the files relate to each other.

<<figure-dependency-graph>> shows a rough graph of the dependencies between different files.
Note that this is not a complete graph,
and there are some additional dependencies between files not described here.

The files can be grouped into several different categories:

* ``<tool>.wake``, for the leaf-level build rules for individual HDL simulator tools
* ``<tool>-sim.wake``, for integration-level build rules that combine individual tools with the notion of a "DUT"
* ``dut-simulator.wake``, the tool-agnostic abstraction of a ``DUTSimulator``
* ``simulator.wake``, data structures that describe the notions of ``SimulationOutput``s and ``TestResult``s
* ``freedom-simulator.wake``, some rules that are specific to the ``vsrc/TestDriver.sv`` testbench


== ``<tool>.wake``

These files describe the leaf-level build rules for individual HDL simulator tools.
They wrap the individual compilation and simulation commands for each individual tool, 
providing a programmatic interface to the commands.
They are meant to be independently reusable without any of the other files in this directory.


== ``<tool>-sim.wake``

These files bake in business logic related to the `DUT`
as well as common command line arguments to the individual simulator tool.
Most of the logic deals with dynamically computing the compilation and simulation arguments
based on a `DUT` argument that is later passed in.
These files are also responsible for invoking the `subscribe` builtin on the
``<tool>DUTSim{Compile,Execute}OptionsHooks`` topics, which may be published to
by individual IP blocks that require additional include paths or other command
line options.

Note that all of the `tuple` members that are of the type ``DUT => a => b => ...``
are meant to emulate dynamic dispatch or a virtual table by allowing the member
to be like a method defined on an object.


== ``dut-simulator.wake``

This file describes the primary data types that the build rules outside of this directory should depend on.
These types are agnostic to the specific tool
and are meant to abstract over the generic concepts of compiling and running HDL simulators.
